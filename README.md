## Quick Install Guide
### If you have git installed
Unity's Package manager, while supporting git, does not come with any embedded git install, so this will only work if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed beforehand.
- Open Unity's Package Manager and add the git url:

```https://github.com/blepmlem/VRChat-Expression-Utility.git#2.4.2```

### If you do not have git installed
- Download [the latest zip file here](https://github.com/blepmlem/VRChat-Expression-Utility/archive/refs/tags/2.4.2.zip) and unzip the folder (not just the content) into your *Packages* folder located in the *root* of your Unity project folder.

Both versions come with built in update functionality.
