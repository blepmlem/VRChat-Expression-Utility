## Quick Install Guide
### If you have git installed
Unity's Package manager, while supporting git, does not come with any embedded git install, so this will only work if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed beforehand.
- Open Unity's Package Manager and add the git url:

```https://github.com/blepmlem/VRChat-Expression-Utility.git#2.5.2```

All versions come with built in update functionality.

### If you do not have git installed
- Grab the latest [Unity Package release here](https://github.com/blepmlem/VRChat-Expression-Utility/releases/download/2.5.2/VRC_Expression_Utility_2.5.2.unitypackage)

# VRChat Expression Utility
